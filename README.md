# Time Series Project

## Anomaly detection on CPU usage


**"Anomaly Detection means to identify unexpected events in a process. It means to detect threats to our systems that may cause harm in terms of security and leakage of important information, but the importance of Anomaly Detection is not limited to security. The data of this project is based on per-minute metrics of the hostâ€™s CPU utilization."**



*"A popular and widely used statistical method for time series forecasting is the ARIMA model. ARIMA is an acronym that stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a class of model that captures a suite of different standard temporal structures in time series data."*


**Step 1:**

Import necessary libraries.

**Step 2:**

Load the datasets.

**Step 3:**

Using matplotlib visualize the data.

**Step 4:** 

Use the ARIMA model to fit the data.

**Step 5:** 

Evaluate the performance

**Step 6:** 

Run the actual prediction by using the most recent 100 observed data points being followed by the 60 predicted points.

**Step 7:**

Perform the same anomaly detection on another segment of the CPU utilization dataset captured at a different time by using the cpu-train-b
